### Simple 1D Kalman Filter:
* The world consists of six landmarks.
* The robot is able to localize itself as it moves.
* The robot performs two cycles of sense and move operations in order to decrease the uncertainty of the robot position.

## Functions:
* sense function performs a measurement update.
* move functions performs a motion update.
